# Corona2Scade
Corona SDK SampleCode implemented for Scade

The purpose is to show how the LUA code from the CoronaSDK SampleCode examples can be implemented in Scade. Scade can generate apps
for both Apple iOS and Android. 

You can download the CoronaSDK examples by downloading their core from https://coronalabs.com/. At the most you'll have to provide
an email address.
