# Corona2Scade
Corona SDK SampleCode implemented for Scade.

Get Scade from: https://www.scade.io/

The purpose is to show how the LUA code from the CoronaSDK SampleCode examples can be implemented in Scade. Scade can generate apps
for both Apple iOS and Android. 

You can download the CoronaSDK examples by downloading their core from https://coronalabs.com/. At the most you'll have to provide
an email address.

I've focused on the UI and the main purpose/function of the example. Some of the "i" info buttons I didn't bother with because the popup refers to Corona-specific conventions. I might go back and try and give SCADE-equivelant info but not a priority.

COMPLETED (for the most part):

Note: All project files and resources will be added when I do the UI. I'll give a % of completion for program logic.
